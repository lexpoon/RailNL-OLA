# Algorithms

## Randomize
The randomize algorithm starts by picking a random station and then connects with a randomly chosen station. It stops when the time constraint is met and then starts with a new route. A connection is only allowed to be used once. 

## Greedy
The greedy algorithm starts with the station with the least amount of connections. It then chooses the station with either the least amount of connections, the lowest amount of minutes or the highest score to connect with each time. 

## Breadth-first


## Depth-first


## Short Route Swap
The short route swap algorithm finds the routes with the lowest K score, deletes them from the solution and tries to add them again to other, existing, routes.

## Hillclimber


## Simulated Annealing
